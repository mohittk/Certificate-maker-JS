# Certificate-maker-JS

<h1> Hey Developers!
Presenting you all the demo 'Certificate Maker'.</h1>
<h2>I have made project using HTML,CSS AND JS.
The code that is used in JS file is not complicated and easy to understand for beginner.
  Other JS libraries that I have used are Pdf-lib.js and Filesaver.js.

Two buttons(Download & Preview) and a search bar is provided for performing appropriate actions.
 By clicking the 'Download' button one can directly download the certificate; by clicking on 'Preview' button one can first preview the certificate, and then download as per need.
